# Permit join forever

This extension permits joining forever (which Zigbee2MQTT 2.0.0 doesn't support out-of-the-box).

**You should never use this extension** but unfortunately it is required for some devices to work properly (like Livolo).
Use with caution as this will make it very easy for someone to hack your Zigbee network!

This extension was created because of https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/25626.
